----------

Three offerings await the spoken Word:

The first,
Portae Klavis Lucis, a prize already made;
The second,
A Scribe's sealed note, which points to distant lands;
The Third,
Echo's voice, held in the hands.

Portae Klavis Lucis, by divine purpose swayed:
If present, it unlocks the holy rite;
If absent, holds the Word in captured light.

It reads the scroll, a fourfold scroll,
A single myth in many forms is told.
